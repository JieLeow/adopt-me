--------------------  NOTES -------------------------

React.createElement returns an react element (in lesson 1&2, a tag name string)
     //param1 : html tag, 
     //param2: tag attribute(s)
     //param3: what's inside the tag (an html element, eg <p>hello world!</p>);

 //the power of react is that: u can have components that is put inside components
 //that is put inside components. REUSABILITY!

variables verity?? 

ReactDOM.render actually renders the component to the browser
  

 2. package.json shows/tracks the dependencies  
        - npm install will grab the same dependencies (good for group project)

 3. npm install -D means developer dependencies - package that are only needed for local testing and dev

 4. prettier config file - {} means default configs

 5. eslint vs prettier 
     -- eslint concerns with style - 
     -- prettier checks for your code formatting 

6. yaml vs json (when .eslint.json)
